The programming education system (TPES) will teach middle school students the 
basics of programming. This service will offer comprehensive lessons and 
activities allowing students to acquire basic programming skills through an 
interactive medium as opposed to many current static-based lessons offered.
TPES aims to peek interest in programming at a younger age and replace the 
non-interactive forms of self-education programming lessons, by presenting
lessons in as easy-to-understand, immersive form factor that will allow
any student to pick up and begin learning.
