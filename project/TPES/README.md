# The Programming Education System/Tide Pod Education System

The programming education system (TPES) will teach middle school students the basics of programming. This service will offer comprehensive lessons and activities allowing students to acquire basic programming skills through an interactive medium as opposed to many current static-based lessons offered. TPES aims to peek interest in programming at a younger age and replace the non-interactive forms of self-education programming lessons, by presenting lessons in as easy-to-understand, immersive form factor that will allow any student to pick up and begin learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to have before being able to use this project.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

To get started, open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After doing all this, you will have installed the Angular CLI on your computer globally

Now, you'll want to navigate into the TPES directory and run the application locally:
