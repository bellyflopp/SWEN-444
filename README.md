# The Programming Education System/Tide Pod Education System

The programming education system (TPES) will teach middle school students the basics of programming. This service will offer comprehensive lessons and activities allowing students to acquire basic programming skills through an interactive medium as opposed to many current static-based lessons offered. TPES aims to peek interest in programming at a younger age and replace the non-interactive forms of self-education programming lessons, by presenting lessons in as easy-to-understand, immersive form factor that will allow any student to pick up and begin learning.
